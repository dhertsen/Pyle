# 
#  This is an example of a config file that can be used by the profile.py script
#  to generate energy profiles.
# 
#  (c) Dietmar Hertsen, February 2014
# 
# 
# 
# EXECUTION
# 
# Each configuration file that is passed to profile.py contains all information
# to create a seperate image with energy profiles. These configuration files must
# have cfg extensions. The profile.py script can always be executed with 'python
# profile.py profiles1.cfg profiles2.cfg'. The name of the output files, if any,
# is specified in the configuration files.
# 
# 
# 
# BLOCK AND LINE OPTIONS
# 
# Profiles are the building units of the images. The consist of bars, horizontal
# lines corresponsding with energy levels, interconnected with connections. A
# single image can contain multiple profiles.
# 
# All data in the configuration file is structures as a block or a line option.
# Comment lines starting with # are ignored. A typical block option looks like
# this:
#     & KEYWORD
#     line1
#     line2
#     line3
#     line4
#     & END KEYWORD
# Capitalization and spaces are ignored in the header and footer. Personally, I
# use capitals for block options, although is not necessary. Empty lines in the
# body are ignored as well. Each line corresponds to a single profile and may
# contain one or more words. If a single word is provided, this option holds for
# the entire profile. If multiple words are given, information about the seperate
# bars, labels, connections, etc. of the profile are given. The words are
# splitted by any amount of whitespace and all leading whitespace is ignored.
# 
# A special type of block option is used for the definition of extra lines and
# texts:
#     & LINES
#     x1=0 x2=1 y1=0 y2=1 extraoption=extravalue
#     & END LINES
# 
# Line options consist of keyword and a value:
#     keyword value
# 
# A limited amount of line options use the following syntax:
#     keyword parameter1=value1 parameter2=value1
# 
# In all cases, whitespace will split words. If this is unwanted, doubleq quotes
# may be used:
#     keyword "sentence value"
# 
#     & KEYWORD
#     a b "c d" #     "very long sentence" #     & END KEYWORD # 
# Several options may be provided as (a) line options, (b) block options with a
# single word per line or (c) block options with multiple words per line. (a)
# will set an option for all profiles, (b) for a single profile and (c) for a
# profile element. The option 'barcolors' for example, sets the color of the
# horizontal lines:
# 
#     barcolors red   --> all bars red
# 
#     & BARCOLORS
#     red
#     green           --> single green profile
#     red
#     & END BARCOLORS
# 
#     & BARCOLORS
#     red red red
#     red green red   --> single green bar
#     red red red
#     & END BARCOLORS
# 
# Single line options have the highest priority if both a block and a line are
# present in the config file.
# 
# The following options can be entered as (a), (b) or (c):
# 'toplabels', 'bottomlabels', 'positions', 'corrections', 'toplabelcolors',
# 'bottomlabelcolors', 'barcolors', 'barlinewidth', 'barlinestyle',
# 'toplabellinespace', 'bottomlabellinespace', 'toplabelsize', 'bottomlabelsize',
# 'connectioncolors', 'connectionlinewidth', 'connectionlinestyle'.
# 
# The following options are only defined per profile and have to be entered as
# (a) or (b): 'colors','references','legend','conversions'.
# 
# The special block options 'texts' and 'lines' can only be specified as (c)
# because they are not connected to a profile. Moreover, the 'energies' block can
# only be given as (c).
# 
# All possible line options:
# 'showplot', 'saveplot', 'conversions', 'corrections', 'references',
# 'roundEnergies', 'colors', 'positions', 'barlinewidth', 'connectionlinewidth',
# 'barlinestyle', 'connectionlinestyle', 'xmargin', 'ymargin', 'secondaryyaxis',
# 'toplabellinespace', 'bottomlabellinespace', 'toplabelsize', 'bottomlabelsize',
# 'showLegend', 'ylabelsize', 'yticksize', 'titlesize', 'legend', 'toplabels',
# 'bottomlabels', 'title', 'width', 'space', 'ylabel', 'toplabelcolors',
# 'bottomlabelcolors', 'barcolors', 'axes', 'size', 'connectioncolors'.
# 
# 
# 
# ENERGIES
# 
# The 'energies' block is the only necessary element of a config file and defines
# the energy levels. It can contain both filenames (Gaussian output files) and
# numerical entries. These energies are transformed according to: (energies -
# references + corrections) * conversions. In the following example, the
# electronic energies are taken from the files in 'energies', the corrections for
# the gibbs free energy are taken 'corrections', the reference for every profile
# is the first value in every profile and the hartree energies taken from the
# Gaussian output files are converted to kJ/mol according to 'conversions':
# 
#     & ENERGIES
#     reactant-a-singlepoint.log TS-a-singlepoint.log product-a-singlepoint.log
#     reactant-b-singlepoint.log TS-b-singlepoint.log product-b-singlepoint.log
#     & END ENERGIES
# 
#     & CORRECTIONS
#     reactant-a-frequency.log TS-a-frequency.log product-a-frequency.log
#     reactant-b-frequency.log TS-b-frequency.log product-b-frequency.log
#     & END CORRECTIONS
# 
#     & REFERENCES
#     value-1
#     value-1
#     & END REFERENCES
# 
#     conversion = 2625.49962
# 
#     energytype energies=electronic corrections=gibbscorrection
# 
# The energytype option defines what kind of energy (correction) is extracted
# from the Gaussian output files
# (electronic,enthalpy,entropy,gibbs,enthalpycorrection,gibbscorrection).  In
# 'corrections' and 'references' both filenames and numerical values can be used.
#
# Entries of the type value-# can be employed in 'references' to refer to a value
# in the same profile. Entries of the type 'value-i-j' can be used to refer to
# value j in profile j. So 'value-1' as a line option will set the reference for
# every profile to its first element, while 'value-1-1' as a line option will set
# the reference to the first energy of the first profile for every bar.
# 
# The value that is used as a reference is energies+corrections when values-i or
# value-i-j is included.
# 
# 
# 
# POSITIONS
# 
# The first bar of every energy profile will be placed at the left side of the
# image. This is called position 1. Subsequent bars will be placed at positions
# 2, 3, etc. extending to the right side. The positions can be manually set,
# however:
# 
#     & POSITIONS
#     1 2 3
#     4 5 6
#     & END POSITIONS
# 
# This will result in two profiles next to eachother.
# 
# 
# 
# LEGEND
# 
# Legends are profile specific and can only be specified as a column matrix or a
# single line keyword:
# 
#     & LEGEND
#     "This is the first profile."
#     "This is the second profile."
#     & END LEGEND
# 
# 
# 
# LABELS AND BLOCK EXPANSION
# 
# Labels can be places above and below the bars (top and bottom labels). Special
# keywords may be used: 'energy' will print the energy (after reference,
# correction and conversion), 'filename' will print the filename that was present
# in the ENERGIES block, 'uniquefilename' prints the unique part of the fillename
# that was present in the ENERGIES block, 'uniqueprofilefilename' will print the
# part that is unique within the profile. For example:
# 
#     & ENERGIES
#     A-a-1.log A-a-2.log A-a-3.log
#     A-b-1.log A-b-2.log A-b-3.log
#     & END ENERGIES
#     
#     uniquefilename:
#     a-1 a-2 a-3
#     b-1 b-2 b-3
#     
#     uiniqueprofilefilename:
#     1 2 3
#     1 2 3
# 
# '-' is used as a delimiter, the log extension is removed.
# 
# The TOPLABELS and BOTTOMLABEL blocks provide an excellent example of how
# options will be expanded to the size of the ENERGIES block. These are all
# equivalent definitions if a 2x2 energy block is present:
# 
# toplabels energy
# 
#     & TOPLABELS
#     energy
#     energy
#     & END TOPLABELS
#     
#     & TOPLABELS
#     energy energy
#     energy energy
#     & END TOPLABELS
# 
# In general, the pattern that was provided will be expanded to match the size of
# the ENERGIES block. Extra rows or columns will be ignored. These examples are
# for a 4x4 energy block:
# 
#     Example 1
# 
#     & TOPLABELS
#     a b c
#     & END TOPLABELS
# 
#     yields
# 
#     a b c a
#     a b c a
#     a b c a
#     a b c a
# 
#     Example 2
# 
#     & TOPLABELS
#     a b
#     c d e
#     & END TOPLABELS
# 
#     yields
# 
#     a b a b
#     c d e c
#     a b a b
#     c d e c
#      
#     Example 3
# 
#     & TOPLABELS
#     a b c d e
#     b
#     c
#     d
#     e
#     & END TOPLABELS
# 
#     will yield
# 
#     a b c d
#     b b b b 
#     c c c c 
#     d d d d 
# 
# If the energies are used as labels, the roundenergies line option can be used
# to specify the wanted number of decimals: roundenergies 1
# 
# All the label types can be mixed:
# 
#     & BOTTOMLABELS
#     energy filename uniquefilename uniqueprofilefilename
#     "Hello world" Hello!
#     & END BOTTOMLABELS
# 
# COLORS AND OTHER PROFILE STYLE OPTIONS
# 
# The colors can be set for all profiles with the colors keyword or per profile
# in the COLORS block. In this way all bars, labels and connections of the
# corresponding profiles will have the same colors. This can be overridden by
# barcolors, toplabelcolors, bottomlabelcolors and connectioncolors. The first
# three will be expanded to the same dimensions as the ENERGIES block,
# connectioncolors needs one less value per profile since the number of
# connections equals the number of bars minus 1.
# 
# Basic colors: b(lue), g(reen), r(ed), c(yan), m(agenta), y(ellow), k or black,
# w(hite). Gray shades can be given as a string encoding a float in the 0-1
# range, e.g. '0.75'.  You can specify the color using an html hex string, as
# in:color = '#eeefff'.
# 
# Other size options that will be expanded to the size of ENERGIES: barlinewidth,
# barlinestyle , toplabellinespace (relative distance between bar and top label),
# bottomlabellinespace (relative distance between bar and bottom label),
# toplabelsize, bottomlabelsize, connectionlinewidth (one less value needed per
# profile), connectionlinestyle (one less value needed per profile).
# 
# Typical linestyles: '', ' ', 'None', '--', '-.', '-', ':' Text size: size in
# points or relative size, e.g. 'small','large','smaller','x-large', etc.
# 
# EXTRA LINES AND TEXTS
# 
# Extra lines can be specified in the following manner:
# 
#     & LINES
#     x1=0 y1=0 x2=1 y2=1 linecolor=black linestyle=- linewidth=1
#     x1=1 y1=2 x2=1 y2=1 linecolor=black linestyle=- linewidth=1
#     & END LINES
# 
# This block draws two linesm each from (x1,y1) to (x2,y2). Style options are
# optional. Texts are specified in the same way:
# 
#     & TEXTS
#     x=0 y=0 color=black size=medium text="Hello world"
#     & END TEXTS
# 
# '1begin', '1middle' and '1end' can be used in the x coordinates to specify the
# beginning, middle or end of bar 1.
# 
# 
# PLOT OPTIONS
# 
# The following options can only be included as line options since they only
# determine the plot area and have no impact on the profiles:
# 
#     showplot yes/no         # show the plot
#     saveplot filename       # profile not saved is saveplot is missing (pdf, png, eps, etc.)
#                             # if both showplot and saveplot are missing,
#                             # the plot will be shown
#     size width=10 height=10 # size of the saved figure
# 
#     xmargin 3               # relative space between the bars and the left and right side of the image
#     ymargin 10              # relative space between the bars and the top and bottom of the image
#                             # Normally, the energy range is chosen automatically. In that case ymargin is
#                             # used for the necessary whitespace.
#     axes ymin=0 ymax=100    # Energy dimensions are set by the user, ymargin is ignored.
# 
#     secondaryyaxis yes/no   # show a second energy axis on the right
#     yticksize medium        # size of the ticks on the energy axes
#     ylabel                  # label of the energy axis, none is missing
#     ylabelsize medium       # size of energy axis label
# 
#     title "Some title"      # title
#     titlesize x-large       # title size
# 
#     width 7                 # relative width of the bars
#     space 2                 # relative space between bars
